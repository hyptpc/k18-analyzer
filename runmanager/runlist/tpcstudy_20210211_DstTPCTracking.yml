# RUN LIST (YAML format)
#
# The allowed keys are
#   queue  <- bsub queue (eg. s, l, etc...)
#   unit   <- dividing event unit
#   nporc  <- number of process for merging (must be less than 20)
#   buff   <- intermediate root files will be placed here if nproc is more than 2
#   bin    <- path to executable binary
#   conf   <- path to conf directory/file from the work directory
#   data   <- path to data directory/file
#   root   <- path to the output ROOT output directory/file
#   dstin  <- list of input files for dst analysis
#             these files are assumed to be in the same root directory of output
#
# Be careful of the indent rule because YAML format is sensitive to it.
# Some problems will happen if there is no default setting declaration.
