#
# RUN LIST (YAML format)
#
# The allowed keys are
#   queue  <- bsub queue (eg. s, l, etc...)
#   qmerge <- bsub queue for merging job to command "hadd"
#   unit   <- dividing event unit
#   nproc  <- number of process for merging (up to 18)
#   buff   <- intermediate root files will be placed here if nproc is more than 2
#             if not set, use the same "root" directory
#   bin    <- path to executable binary
#   conf   <- path to conf directory/file from the work directory
#   data   <- path to data directory/file
#   root   <- path to the output ROOT output directory/file
#
# Be careful of the indent rule because YAML format is sensitive to it.
# Some problems will happen if there is no default setting declaration.
